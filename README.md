## About Burger Love

* Burger-Love! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- These Burgers are Available Now!

* Each burger in the waiting area also has an `Eat!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page and be considered `Devoured`.

* The app will store every burger in the MySQL database, whether devoured or not.

* The app is viewed through Heroku, a hosting platform for developers.
